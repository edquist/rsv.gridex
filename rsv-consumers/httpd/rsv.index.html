<p>The html-consumer has not yet run.  Once it runs this page will be replaced by a table of results.  The html-consumer should run within 5 minutes of turning RSV on.

<p>If you think the html-consumer should have run and you are still seeing this page, here are troubleshooting tips:
<ul>
  <li>Run <em>rsv-control --job-list</em> and make sure that the html-consumer is running.  If it is not running, make sure you have <a href="https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallRSV#Start_Stop_Services">turned RSV on</a>.
  <li>Look in the log files at <em>/var/log/rsv/consumers/html-consumer.(output|err|log)</em> for problems.
  <li>Contact OSG for help by creating a ticket at <a href="https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open">https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open</a>.
